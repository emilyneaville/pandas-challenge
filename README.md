# Background and Context

This project utilizes Pandas to bring both high-level and acute analyses and summaries of the city's school district data. This analysis will aid the school board in making data-driven decisions and in coming to conclusions about budget, spending, and how to better allocate resources based on the needs of the district.

The two datasets used for analysis are two csv files titled [schools_complete.csv](https://github.com/emilyneaville/pandas-challenge/blob/main/PyCitySchools/Resources/schools_complete.csv) and [students_complete.csv](https://github.com/emilyneaville/pandas-challenge/blob/main/PyCitySchools/Resources/students_complete.csv). schools_complete.csv includes key information about the each school in the district such as 'Student ID', 'school_name', 'type', 'size', and 'budget'.
